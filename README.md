# shrinket.io - The PHP URL Shortener

I'm currently working the API behind this site, which means that the actual URL shortening isn't currently functional as the site will also rely on this API for functionality.

### Future ambitions for the project include:
- The ability to create vanity URLs (shrinket.io/yoursite).
- Use custom domains (yoursite.com/randomstring).
- Releasing the API for public use to integrate shortening URLs to other projects.
- Releasing a CLI tool to create shortened URLs programmatically.
